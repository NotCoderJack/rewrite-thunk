# Trying to understand how redux-thunk works

* Redux-Thunk is rewritten using as much of ES5 as possible so that the code is easier to follow. 
* Also lot of console.info and console.dir is added to print details into the console so that it becomes easy to understand.

This is done only to help understand how redux-thunk works.
